# vibe

Welcome to Project Vibe: your go-to Spotify playlist generator before heading out on a drive!

**Vibe will only ask you to input:**

1. Your starting location
2. Your desired destination
3. Your current mood

**And from this, will curate a unique playlist for your journey based on factors such as:**

* The length of your journey, and how that matches to the way you feel (_daunted at a long drive?_).
* The weather in both your departure and arrival destinations (_arriving to a destination with better or worse weather?_).
* The time of day (_is the sun about to set as you drive?_).
* Music that's popular in the local area of your destination, that also matches your taste.
* Your current heavy rotation of music.

## Inspiration for the Name

Whilst the aim of this project is to accurately curate a Spotify playlist to set the perfect _vibe_ for your ride, I'm also currently learning Portuguese, and this is also an acronym for the slightly more Brazilian phrase **_v_**_amos_ **_i_**_ntensificar o_ **_b_**_om_ **_e_**_squema_, which roughly translate as slang to English as _let's get this vibe right_.
